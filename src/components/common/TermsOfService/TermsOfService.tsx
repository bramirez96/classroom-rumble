          <h2>5. International Transfers of Personal Information</h2>
          <p>
            The personal information we collect is stored and processed in
            United States, or where we or our partners, affiliates and
            third-party providers maintain facilities. By providing us with your
            personal information, you consent to the disclosure to these
            overseas third parties.
          </p>

          <p>
            We will ensure that any transfer of personal information from
            countries in the European Economic Area (EEA) to countries outside
            the EEA will be protected by appropriate safeguards, for example by
            using standard data protection clauses approved by the European
            Commission, or the use of binding corporate rules or other legally
            accepted means.
          </p>

          <p>
            Where we transfer personal information from a non-EEA country to
            another country, you acknowledge that third parties in other
            jurisdictions may not be subject to similar data protection laws to
            the ones in our jurisdiction. There are risks if any such third
            party engages in any act or practice that would contravene the data
            privacy laws in our jurisdiction and this might mean that you will
            not be able to seek redress under our jurisdiction’s privacy laws.
